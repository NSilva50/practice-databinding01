I went with the approach coaxed by, applying the names, gender, and living conditions into string interpolatons
and print them to a blank page.

I had a lot of difficulty with this practice, attempting to apply my javascript knowledge into typpescript, and not understanding what a property was or consisted of resulted in me being stuck.

Thank you for helping me teach!
